## Module Challenge 02

## Description

The purpose of this project was to show the important of having clean, readible that is in accordance to accessibility standards. This is important because we want our deployed application optimized for any and all search engines.

Our motivation is "quality first."

We built this project to have a reference point of the standard that is required for every build. Quality must always come first.

The problem (ugly, redundant code) was resolved. Even with 20 lines of notes in the CSS file, I reduced the lines of code from 200 to 152 lines without breaking the application. Specific changes can be seen in the HTML and CSS notes in the "Solved" folder. The former code can be found in the "Unsolved" folder.

I learned that this is a good model to follow for all future projects and affirmed my belief that quality can always be improved.

## Module Challenge 02

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a portfolio to showcase our skills and talents to future employers, business partners, and teammates.

It is important to set ourselves up for success both for the course and in our coding endevours beyond.

I learned that a good website takes time. It's good to work off the skills foundation I've set from previous projects, however it is important to get creative and try new things. To "make it mine" while still maintaining a pleasurable user experience and producing quantifiable, beneficial outcomes for my future clients is the goal. Certainly, this portfolio will help showcase this in the near future.
